//Iteration 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Add Random Affirmation and Mantra feature
  // [] When user selects a message option and then clicks the "Receive Message" button, the user sees a random message from the list of possible messages for that category.

  // select affirmation or mantra, then click Receive Message, random message appears from affirmation array or mantra array

  //select input button (query selector), assign it to event listener, so sort of logic if input is selected(checked?) and then button is clicked (query selector, new button and new event listener), then on click show random message (math.random function) from correct array

  //if input checked and button clicked, run random message function

var mantras = ["Breathing in, I send myself love. Breathing out, I send love to someone else who needs it.", "Donâ€™t let yesterday take up too much of today.", "Every day is a second chance.", "Tell the truth and love everyone.", "I am free from sadness.", "I am enough.", "In the beginning it is you, in the middle it is you and in the end it is you.", "I love myself.", "I am present now.", "Inhale the future, exhale the past.", "This too shall pass.", "Yesterday is not today.", "The only constant is change.", "Onward and upward.", "I am the sky, the rest is weather."];
