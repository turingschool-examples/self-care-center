var mantra = [
  Breathing in, I send myself love. Breathing out, I send love to someone else who needs it.

Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.

Every day is a second chance.

Tell the truth and love everyone.

I am free from sadness.

I am enough.

In the beginning it is you, in the middle it is you and in the end it is you.

I love myself.

I am present now.

Inhale the future, exhale the past.

This too shall pass.

Yesterday is not today.

The only constant is change.

Onward and upward.

I am the sky, the rest is weather.
