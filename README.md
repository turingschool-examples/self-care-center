# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. I have built an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

## Project Roadmap


1. Create a webpage that looks like the below:

2. When a user selects a message option and then clicks the “Receive Message” button, the user sees a random message from the list of possible messages for that category. When the message appears, the meditation icon disappears from the message area:

3. User can add their own message: When the user clicks “Add Message” a form will appear in the message box. When the user clicks the “Submit” button, that message automatically displays in the message box, instead of the meditation icon:

4. If the user doesn’t specify the type of message, they get an error and are unable to submit their message until the type is specified:

5. I've ensured that the user never sees a repeated message until they’ve seen them all.
After they’ve seen them all, an alert appears that they will now start seeing repeat messages:

6. When a message appears, it should appear with a “Favorite” button:

7. When the “Favorite” button is clicked, that message is added to a new list of favorite messages. Users can view their favorites by clicking the “View Favorites” button. When the “View Favorites” button is clicked, users are taken to a new page that displays all of their favorite messages:

8. Users should be able to navigate back to the main page by clicking a button:
