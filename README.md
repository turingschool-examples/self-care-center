## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. <br />
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. This is an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value through humorous phrases from their favorite syndicated television show.
### What does the Self Care Center do?

  #### Basic Functions
  The user can select either an affirmation or a mantra using the radio buttons. Once selected, the user can click the 'Receive Message' button and their selected phrase will appear.<br />

  #### Error Handling
  If the user does not like the provided mantra or affirmation, or simply wishes to read more humorous phrases or perhaps scrutinize whether the given phrase is *in fact* a mantra rather than an affirmation, they may click the clear button. The phrase will then disappear and the Buddha icon will reappear, allowing the user to once again make a selection. The user can not select more than one radio button. The page by default has the 'affirmation' radio button selected so that the user may not continue without having chosen a single option.

#### Future Additions
  In the next update, the app will allow the user to favorite a message. The message will then be displayed on a 'saved messages' page. Self Care Center may also remove repeated messages and inform the viewer if they have looked through all of the messages.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).
