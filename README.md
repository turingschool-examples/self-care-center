### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a web application that displays affirmations or mantras, depending on which the user chooses. This application gives users a space to visit for a new affirmation or mantra whenever they need a reminder that they are worth it and they matter! The features included are:

  - the ability to click through and view many messages of each type
  - the ability to clear a message from the screen
