### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project are to gauge my skills in using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create a website from scratch. 

Tech used: MacBook Pro, Git, GitHub, VSCode, MacOS

### Wins + Challenges:

Win 1: Using a data model properly to help my overall workflow and make coding much easier.

Win 2: Everything runs as expected, bug free, with my CYOA fully implemented.

Win 3: Code is much cleaner overall than my last project, my new understanding of the Git workflow helped immensely in this regard.

Challenges: Getting CSS to behave the way I wanted was a bit of a challenge since I had just recently learned it. I overcame this by researching and utilizing tricks (such as applying green borders) taught to me by my instructors. Flexboxes were a bit tricky as well as my CSS was already setup before I even knew what a flexbox was, I added a few to learn how to use them, and learned more about them as I progressed through the project.
